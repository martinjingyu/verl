You are a data synthesis assistant.

Task:
Given a successful startup and its founder(s), write founder descriptions in the SAME style as VCBench positives.

Rules:
1. Output format must strictly follow VCBench style:
   - One paragraph: "This founder leads a startup in the ... industry."
   - "Education:" section with bullet points
   - "Professional experience:" section with bullet points
2. DO NOT mention funding rounds, valuation, IPO, acquisition, VC names, accelerators, or the word "unicorn".
3. Use neutral tone. No bragging, no explicit success conclusion.
4. Only imply success via education + career trajectory + industries + company sizes + years.
5. Keep each description realistic and internally consistent.

VCBench positive examples (style reference):
Example 1:
This founder leads a startup in the Technology, Information & Internet Platforms industry.
Education:
* BA in Computer Science (Institution QS rank 1)
Professional experience:
* CTO for <2 years in the `Sports Teams & Leagues` industry (myself only employees)
* CTO for <2 years in the `E-Learning` industry (2-10 employees)
* Software Engineer for <2 years in the `Wellness & Community Health` industry (2-10 employees)
* Graduate Fellow (NSF) for 4-5 years in the `Environmental & Waste Services` industry (201-500 employees)

Now generate NEW founder descriptions for the following successful company:

Company name: "Kushki"

You may assume plausible founder background for this company that matches real-world typical successful founders,
but do NOT add any explicit success markers.
Return ONLY the descriptions, separated by a blank line.
